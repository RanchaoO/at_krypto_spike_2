# at_krypto_spike_2

Implementation for the at_krypto application using the at_cookbook application code as a template.

## Getting Started

Clone this application from the `at_demos` repository. If you haven't used the `at_hello_world` app yet, we highly encourage you to check that out first. Make sure that your virtual environment (i.e. Docker containers) are running whenever you use an @protocol application.
